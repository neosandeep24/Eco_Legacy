<h1>💡Inspiration</h1>
Witnessing the escalating environmental crises, such as climate change🌧️, deforestation🌲, pollution🏭, and habitat destruction, served as a strong motivation to take action from my end. Recognizing the severity of these issues and the potential consequences for future generations inspired a deep sense of responsibility and drove me to make a positive impact by building this project.

<h1>⭐What it does</h1>
**Eco Legacy🌳 is a platform intended to provide resources to save environment**. It provides resources like blogs and famous environmentalists who created a huge impact and users can also explore books📚 related to sustainability and environment🌲. The project uses Google's Books API in order to return to the user a list of books related to environment and other related aspects. It also collects payments and promotes plantation🌲.

<h1>⚒️ How I built it</h1>
I used _React JS_,_CSS_ for styling, _Axios_ to make API requests , _Google API's_ to fetch the books list and Github for developing the application 📟.

<h1>🔮What's next for Eco Legacy🌳</h1>
<ul>
<li>1. Expand📈 the project by providing the feature to subscribe to our news letter which includes environmental aspects and other events happening across the world.</li>
2. I would also to add a functionality where users can plan, create events 🏘️ and encourage user collaboration.
</ul>
